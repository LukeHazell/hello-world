# hello-world

Hello people,

My name is Luke and I consider myself a bit of a beginner at programming right now but I hope to improve my skills and one day
work as a software developer.
I first became interested in programming during my final year of university. I decided to do my dissertation in the area of
computational chemistry and this is when I wrote my first program which modelled interactions between atoms. I used resources
online to teach myself the basics of python for my dissertation and eventually also learned the basics of c++.
I am currently studying on a PGCE course and would like to use my link to education and my love of computer games to one day
develop educational games for students of all ages!
